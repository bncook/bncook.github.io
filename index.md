# **Welcome to my website!**

**Hello! My name is Braden Cook, and this is my website!**

I am currently a graduating senior at Massachusetts Institute of Technology
(MIT) studying Electrical Engineering and Computer Science with a humanities
concentration in Music! Here, on my website, I have displayed some neat 
projects and music compositions I have made during my time at MIT.
