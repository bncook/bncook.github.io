# Compositions
In order to graduate, every MIT student needs to have a concentration in
some humanities subject like Literature, History, etc. While at MIT, I 
got my concentration in Music, which involved taking serveral music history
and theory classes that made my head hurt...

My favorite music classes were **Harmony and Counterpoint I and II** where
we learned some of the fundamentals of classical music theory. For each
class, we had to take a piano lab, take a musicianship (sight-singing) lab, 
and compose a piece of music for our final project. Below are the two
compositions that I made for my Harmony and Counterpoint Classes.
