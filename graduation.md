# Acknowledgements
### _First and Foremost_
I would like to thank my Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ, 
without whom any of this would be possible.

### My Family
I would especially like to thank my parents for investing so much of their time
and money in my education, and encouraging me to put God first and to always put
forward my very best. Thank you to my siblings for always beings supportive of me
and for giving me amazing examples to look up to. Thank you to my amazing grandparents - 
Nana and my grandfather (Papa), Grandma Becky and Grandpa Dave, and Grandpa LeRoy - 
for every call, text, card, and for your outpouring of love during my time in college.

Thank you also to my Uncle A, Aunty Keiko, and my cousin Alonzo for always being there
for me and my siblings and welcoming us with open arms. To my Uncle Sean, Aunty
Rosemary, and my cousins Chandler and Carrington, thank you for your support over the years
(and for Carl's Jr...). To all my extended family thank you for you love and support! 

### The Friends I made at MIT
I would also like to thank all of the friends that I made at MIT. You all have made 
my college experience so memorable and enjoyable. In particular, I would like to thank...
* All of my friends from Next House (2W). I miss you all very much
* MIT Every Nation Campus for being a supportive Christian Community on Campus
* The MIT Marine Robotics Team for being such an amazing and talented community
that pushed me to continue learning and innovating
